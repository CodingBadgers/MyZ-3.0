How can I help with development?
================================

Are you a programmer?

* Yes: Fantastic! I would love to work with the community on this project. If you ever have an addition or a bugfix that you're just dying to fix, simply fork this repository and hack on it to your hearts content. Keep it neat though! Pull requests will be merged wherever possible. Of course, for recognition, add your name to the plugin YAML.
* No: No worries! You can still help out! See the Issues tab off to the right? If, in your adventures in MyZ, you ever find a bug, just hit that button and report it. Try to follow the sample issue though, or it might not be fixed. 

Are you a long-term user/supporter of MyZ?

* Yes: By no means is it a requirement, but donations keep this project alive. If you want to support a hardworking high-school student, donation info can be found below.
* No: Just using MyZ means a lot to me. Prior to the 3.0 release, it has seen over 10,000 downloads. Stick around for awhile, I'm sure you'll love the gamemode. 

Do you rent domain names?

* Yes: If you're willing, I'm looking for a free domain to use for MyZ, simply for data storage and serverwide Metrics. Essentially, it would hold any seasonal/holiday mob perks, etc. and have some scripting to display worldwide zombie kills, player kills, and more! A MySQL database is also a requirement.
* No: Hey, no worries. Again, I'm happy if you're happy :) 

Are you a skilled graphic designer/videographer?

* Yes: Any MyZ-related artwork that you send to jordan.sicherman@brentwood.bc.ca, I will be sure to include either on a MyZ-specific website or on the dev.bukkit page. Please don't use this for self-advertising though.
* No: Refer to the previous answer for No ;). 

What about donating?
====================

PayPal: jordan.sicherman@brentwood.bc.ca

Include with your donation your server IP and port (if a public server) as well as your server name or your own Minecraft username (case sensitive) if you would like some sort of recognition for your support! No donation is too small.

Example:

* Donation: 0.99 CAD
* Server IP: 172.0.0.1:8080 (don't post your IP unless it's a PUBLIC server ie. no localhost/loopback address/internal IP)
* Server Name: MyCraft
* Username: MrTeePee 

What's left?

Known Caveats
=============

In some scenarios when you reload the server after updating the MyZ jar, mobs in unloaded chunks can cause the server to crash when those chunks become loaded. It does not corrupt your world, or is even harmful. Simply restart the server. For this reason, try to keep reloading MyZ to a minimum.
